			<h1>Lab 2</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>My challenge will be to add pictures and a cool cursive font to my page. Changing the colors is easy but we will see.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I ran into a lot of problems in trying to do what I wanted. I tried multiple times with the font and it wasn't working. Other resources didn't help me and I think I just need to ask a TA for a one on one appointment because I need to be physically shown on my computer why it isn't working. Also with the photo I tried to upload. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab did not go that well for me. It was very frustrating and I for a few minutes I thought I accidently deleted everything. Honestly I don't think I like coding, thats what this lab showed me. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>You are looking at the results, they are not very good but I spent a few hours and all I did was get myself worked up. </p>
